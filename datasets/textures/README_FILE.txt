In this document there are attached twelve .csv files. For each file, there are 200 raws with 2048 values. These are the data obtained from the tactile sensor in this work (see the paper document for more information).

Each raw is an iteration of the 200 iterations performed for every texture in this work (see Section III -> Materials and Methods, Subsection D -> Data Gathering Procedure).

There is also an image with the twelve textures and their corresponding label, so it is easy to identify them (see also Section III -> Materials and Methods, Subsection C -> Texture Samples).
